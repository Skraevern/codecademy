# Classing It Up
# We’d like our classes to do more than… well, nothing, so we’ll have to add some code between our class Person and end.

# You may have noticed in our example back in the first exercise that we started our class definition off with a method called initialize. You can think of initialize as the function that “boots up” each object the class creates.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Go ahead and define an initialize method for your Person class. No need to put anything in the method body just yet.

class Person
  def initialize
  end
end
