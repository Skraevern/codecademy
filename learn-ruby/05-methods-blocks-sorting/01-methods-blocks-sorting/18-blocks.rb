# Blocks
# Letâ€™s go over what we learned about blocks.

# numbers = [5, 2, 8]
# sum = 0
# numbers.each do |n|
#   sum += n
# end
# puts sum
# The example above is just a reminder about syntax. We calculate the sum of a list of numbers.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Add a block after .each that multiplies each item by itself and puts the result to the console.

my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

my_array.each { |item| puts item * item }

# 1
# 4
# 9
# 16
# 25
