# All Aboard the Hash Rocket!
# The hash syntax you’ve seen so far (with the => symbol between keys and values) is sometimes nicknamed the hash rocket style.

# numbers = {
#   :one => 1,
#   :two => "two",
#   :three => 3,
# }
# This is because the => looks like a tiny rocket!

# Let’s build a hash from the ground up using symbols as keys.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Create a hash called movies with symbols as keys and strings as values.

# Inside your hash, add two key/value pairs.

# The keys should be the names of movies.

# The values should be quick descriptions or reviews.

# Check out the Hint if you want an example to get you started!

movies = {
    :phantom_manace => "First movie",
    :rise_of_skywalker => "Last movie"
  }
