# Extend Your Knowledge
# Whereas include mixes a module’s methods in at the instance level (allowing instances of a particular class to use the methods), the extend keyword mixes a module’s methods at the class level. This means that class itself can use the methods, as opposed to instances of the class.

# Instructions
# Check out the code in the editor. We’ve extended TheHereAnd with ThePresent, allowing it to use the now method. Click Run to see the effect!

# ThePresent has a .now method that we'll extend to TheHereAnd

module ThePresent
    def now
      puts "It's #{Time.new.hour > 12 ? Time.new.hour - 12 : Time.new.hour}:#{Time.new.min} #{Time.new.hour > 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM'} (GMT)."
    end
  end
  
  class TheHereAnd
    extend ThePresent
  end
  
  TheHereAnd.now
