# For Instance...
# Good! A caveat, though: global variables can be changed from anywhere in your program, and they are generally not a very good idea. It’s much better to create variables with limited scope that can only be changed from a few places!

# For example, instance variables belong to a particular object (or “instance”). Let’s get in some practice with instance variables! We’ve added our Person class from before to the editor.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Add age and profession parameters to the initialize method, then set these equal to instance variables in the body of the method. Use the name/@name example as a guide.

lass Person
  def initialize(name, age, profession)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @profession = profession
  end
end
