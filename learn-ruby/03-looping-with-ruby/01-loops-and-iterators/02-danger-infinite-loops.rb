# Danger: Infinite Loops!
# Did you see that? The loop printed out the numbers 1 to 10, then stopped. This was because the loop’s condition said to continue while counter was less than 11; since counter went up by 1 each time through the loop, the loop stopped when counter hit 11.

# What if we’d forgotten to increment counter? It would have stayed at 1, the loop would have kept checking to see if it was less than 11 (and 1 is always less than 11), and the loop would never have ended. This is called an infinite loop and it will cause your programs to crash. Avoid them at all costs!

# Instructions
# 1.
# The while loop in the editor is currently an infinite loop. Correct it so it will end! (Be careful—if you click Run right away, you’ll start the infinite loop and you’ll have to refresh the page.)

i = 0
while i < 5
  puts i
  i = i + 1
