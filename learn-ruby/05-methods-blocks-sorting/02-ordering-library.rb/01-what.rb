# What You'll Be Building
# We noticed in the last lesson that .sort! didn’t have a built-in way of handling sorting in reverse alphabetical order. Now that we know how to write our own Ruby methods, we can fix that!

# Instructions
# 1.
# The code in the editor should look familiar—there’s only one new idea (on line 1). When you’re ready, click Run to execute the code and start building your own method.

def alphabetize(arr, rev=false)
    if rev

      arr.sort { |item1, item2| item1 <=> item2 }
    end
  end
  
  books = ["Heart of Darkness", "Code Complete", "The Lorax", "The Prophet", "Absalom, Absalom!"]
  
  puts "A-Z: #{alphabetize(books)}"
  puts "Z-A: #{alphabetize(books, true)}"
  

#   A-Z: ["Absalom, Absalom!", "Code Complete", "Heart of Darkness", "The Lorax", "The Prophet"]
# Z-A: ["The Prophet", "The Lorax", "Heart of Darkness", "Code Complete", "Absalom, Absalom!"]
