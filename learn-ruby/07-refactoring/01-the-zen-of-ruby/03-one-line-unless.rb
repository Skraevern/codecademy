# The One-Line Unless
# You can do the exact same thing with the unless statement. The order is the same as before: something for Ruby to do, the unless keyword, and then an expression that evaluates to true or false.

# Remember, you donâ€™t need an end when you write a one-line if or unless!

# Instructions
# 1.
# Go ahead and type a one-line unless statement in the editor to the right. It can be whatever you like.

# Type your Ruby code below!
my_boolean = false
puts "Not True" unless my_boolean == true

# Not True
