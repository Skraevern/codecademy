# attr_accessor
# If we want to both read and write a particular variable, thereâ€™s an even shorter shortcut than using attr_reader and attr_writer. We can use attr_accessor to make a variable readable and writeable in one fell swoop.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Here we have an attr_reader and an attr_writer for :job. Go ahead and replace these with an attr_accessor!

class Person
    attr_reader :name
    attr_reader :job
    attr_writer :job
    
    def initialize(name, job)
      @name = name
      @job = job
    end
  end

  class Person
    attr_reader :name
    attr_accessor :job
    
    def initialize(name, job)
      @name = name
      @job = job
    end
  end
