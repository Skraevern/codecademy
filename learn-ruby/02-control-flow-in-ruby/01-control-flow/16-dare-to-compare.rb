# Dare to Compare
# Now let’s review comparators / relational operators. We’ve turned the tables a bit!

# Remember, comparators need to compare two values to each other to result in true or false

# 10 > 8 # true
# 8 > 10 # false
# 8 == 10 # false
# 8 != 10 # true

# Instructions
# 1.
# We’re letting you know what value (true or false) we want each variable to have, and your job is to add an expression that evaluates to the correct value using comparators.

# test_1 should be false
test_1 = false

# test_2 = should be false
test_2 = 1 > 2

# test_3 = should be true
test_3 = 2 == 2
