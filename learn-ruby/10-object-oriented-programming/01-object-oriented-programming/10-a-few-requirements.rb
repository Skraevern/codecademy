# A Few Requirements
# Perfect!

# Some modules, like Math, are already present in the interpreter. Others need to be explicitly brought in, however, and we can do this using require. We can do this simply by typing

# require 'module'
# We want to use the Ruby Date module to show today’s date, but we haven’t required it yet!

# Instructions
# 1.
# Go ahead and require 'date' on line 1 so the code on line 3 will work.

require 'date'

puts Date.today
