# Iterating Over Arrays
# Iterating over arrays is easier than it looks.

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# numbers.each { |element| puts element }
# In the example above, we create an array called numbers with 5 elements.
# Then we say, “Take this array and for each element, print it to the console.” As usual, we can use any placeholder name for the bit between two | | characters.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Use the .each iterator to puts out each element of the languages array.

# Make sure to use puts instead of print, so each element is on its own line.

languages = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"]

languages.each { |element| puts element }

# HTML
# CSS
# JavaScript
# Python
# Ruby
