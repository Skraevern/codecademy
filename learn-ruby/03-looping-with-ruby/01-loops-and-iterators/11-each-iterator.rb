# The .each Iterator
# Great work! You’re really getting the hang of this.

# The loop iterator is the simplest, but also one of the least powerful. A more useful iterator is the .each method, which can apply an expression to each element of an object, one at a time. The syntax looks like this:

# object.each { |item| 
#   # Do something 
# }
# You can also use the do keyword instead of {}:

# object.each do |item| 
#   # Do something 
# end
# The variable name between | | can be anything you like: it’s just a placeholder for each element of the object you’re using .each on.

# Instructions
# Take a look at the code in the editor. When you’re pretty sure you know what it’ll do, click Run to test your theory.

# array = [1,2,3,4,5]

 array.each do |x|
   x += 10
   puts "#{x}"
 end

#  11
# 12
# 13
# 14
# 15
