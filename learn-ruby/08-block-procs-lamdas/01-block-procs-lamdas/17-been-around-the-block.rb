# Been Around the Block a Few Times
# Youâ€™re basically a Ruby block master at this point. This should be pretty easy!

# Instructions
# 1.
# The odds_n_ends array is full of all sorts of objects, but we only want the integers (numbers without decimal bits).

# Create a new variable, ints, and store the result of calling odds_n_ends.select method with a block that checks if the element .is_a? Integer.

# puts ints at the end of the file in order to see the final contents of the array.

odds_n_ends = [:weezard, 42, "Trady Blix", 3, true, 19, 12.345]

ints = odds_n_ends.select { |item| item.is_a? Integer }

puts ints

# [42, 3, 19]
