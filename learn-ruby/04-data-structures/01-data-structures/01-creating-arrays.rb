# Creating Arrays
# Earlier we saw that an array can be used to store a list of values in a single variable. You can stuff any number of numbers in there, you can repeat numbers, and they donâ€™t have to be in numeric order!

# Instructions
# 1.
# Declare a variable, my_array, in the editor, and set it equal to an array of your choice. Check the Hint if you need a syntax refresher.

my_array = [123, 333, 333, 1]
