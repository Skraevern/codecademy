# Going Public
# Great work! Now we’ll get into the details of public and private methods.

# Methods are public by default in Ruby, so if you don’t specify public or private, your methods will be public. In this case, however, we want to make it clear to people reading our code which methods are public. We do this by putting public before our method definitions, like so:

# class ClassName
#   # Some class stuff
#   public
#   def public_method
#     # public_method stuff
#   end
# end
# Note that everything after the public keyword through the end of the class definition will now be public unless we say otherwise. (We’ll say otherwise in the next exercise.)

# Instructions
# 1.
# For now, let’s add a public method called bark to Dog. The bark method should puts "Woof!".

class Dog
    def initialize(name, breed)
      @name = name
      @breed = breed
    end
    
    public
    def bark
      puts "Woof!"
    end  
  end
