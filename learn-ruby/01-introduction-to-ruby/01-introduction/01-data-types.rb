# < Data Types: Numbers, Strings, Booleans
# In Ruby, your information (or data) can come in different types. There are three data types in Ruby that we’re interested in right now: Numeric (any number), Boolean (which can be true or false), and String (words or phrases like "I'm learning Ruby!").

# Computer programs exist to quickly analyze and manipulate data. For that reason, it’s important for us to understand the different data types that we can use in our programs.

# Reminder: never use quotation marks (‘ or “) with booleans, or Ruby will think you’re talking about a string (a word or phrase) instead of a value that can be true or false. It’s also important to remember that Ruby is case-sensitive (it cares about capitalization). 

# 1.
# Set the following variables to the corresponding values:

# my_num to the value 25
# my_boolean to the value true (note the capitalization!)
# my_string to the value "Ruby"

my_num = 25    # Add your code here!

my_boolean = true     # And here!

my_string = "Ruby"    # Also here.

puts my_num
puts my_boolean
puts my_string
