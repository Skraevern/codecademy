# You Know This!
# We learned a bit about blocks in Loops & Iterators and Methods, Blocks, & Sorting. We said earlier that a block is like a nameless method, but that’s not quite true. (We’ll get to actual nameless methods, called lambdas, later in this lesson.)

# A Ruby block is just a bit of code that can be executed. Block syntax uses either do..end or curly braces ({}), like so:

# [1, 2, 3].each do |num|
#   puts num
# end
# # ==> Prints 1, 2, 3 on separate lines
 
# [1, 2, 3].each { |num| puts num }
# # ==> Prints 1, 2, 3 on separate lines
# Blocks can be combined with methods like .each and .times to execute an instruction for each element in a collection (like a hash or array).

# Instructions
# 1.
# Let’s do a little review! Use .times and a block to puts the string “I’m a block!” five times.

5.times do 
    puts "I'm a block!"
  end
