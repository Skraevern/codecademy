# Repeat for More Input
# All right! Now we need to repeat what we’ve done for last_name, city, and state.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Add print prompts, variables, and gets.chomps for the user’s last name, city, and state/province. Use last_name as the variable for the user’s last name, city for their city, and state for their state or province. (Hint: prompt the user to provide an abbreviation for their state or province, such as “NY” for New York. This will naturally lead us to use .upcase later!)

print "What`s your first name? "
first_name = gets.chomp

print "What`s your last name? "
last_name = gets.chomp

print "Which city do you live in? "
city = gets.chomp

print "Which state? "
state = gets.chomp
