# LOOPS & ITERATORS
# Loop the Loop with Loop
# Great work! Weâ€™ll give you a bit of a break from the numbers game.

# m = 0
# loop do
#   m += 1
#   print m
#   break if m == 10
# end
# In the example above, we print out 12345678910 since we loop 10 times.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Use the loop iterator to print out the string "Ruby!" 30 times.

# Make sure to type the string exactly as shown!

my_string = "Ruby!"
i = 0

loop do
  print "#{my_string} "
  i += 1
  break if i == 30
end


# Output:
# Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!
