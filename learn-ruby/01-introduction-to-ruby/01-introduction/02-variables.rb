# Variables
# One of the most basic concepts in computer programming is the variable. You can think of a variable as a word or name that grasps a single value. For example, let’s say you needed the number 25 from our last example, but you’re not going to use it right away. You can set a variable, say my_num, to grasp the value 25 and hang onto it for later use, like this:

# my_num = 25
# Declaring variables in Ruby is easy: you just write out a name like my_num, use = to assign it a value, and you’re done! If you need to change a variable, no sweat: just type it again and hit = to assign it a new value.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Set the variable my_num to the value 100, then click the Run button to run your code.

my_num = 100

# Write code above this line!

puts my_num
