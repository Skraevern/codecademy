# Class Syntax
# A basic class consists only of the class keyword and the name of the class. Check it out:

#     class NewClass
#       # Class magic here
#     end
# Our NewClass has the ability to create new Ruby objects of class NewClass (just like "Hello!" is a String and 4 is a Fixnum). By convention, class names start with a capital letter and use CamelCase instead of relying_on_underscores.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Create a class called Person in the editor. Donâ€™t put anything between class Person and end just yet.

class Person
