# How Blocks Differ from Methods
# There are some differences between blocks and methods, however.

# Check out the code in the editor. The capitalize method capitalizes a word, and we can continually invoke the capitalize method by name. We can capitalize("matz"), capitalize("eduardo"), or any string we like to our heartsâ€™ content.

# However, the block that we define (following .each) will only be called once, and in the context of the array that we are iterating over. It appears just long enough to do some work for each, then vanishes into the night.

# Instructions
# Make sense? Run the code to see the magical marriage of methods and blocks.

# method that capitalizes a word
def capitalize(string) 
    puts "#{string[0].upcase}#{string[1..-1]}"
  end
  
  capitalize("ryan") # prints "Ryan"
  capitalize("jane") # prints "Jane"
  
  # block that capitalizes each string in the array
  ["ryan", "jane"].each {|string| puts "#{string[0].upcase}#{string[1..-1]}"} # prints "Ryan", then "Jane"


# Output:
# Ryan
# Jane
# Ryan
# Jane
