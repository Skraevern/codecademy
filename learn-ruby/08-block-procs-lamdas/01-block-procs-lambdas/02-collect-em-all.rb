# Collect 'Em All
# Good! There are a bunch of really useful Ruby methods that take blocks. One we haven’t covered yet is collect.

# The collect method takes a block and applies the expression in the block to every element in an array. Check it out:

# my_nums = [1, 2, 3]
# my_nums.collect { |num| num ** 2 }
# # ==> [1, 4, 9]
# If we look at the value of my_nums, though, we’ll see it hasn’t changed:

# my_nums
# # ==> [1, 2, 3]
# This is because .collect returns a copy of my_nums, but doesn’t change (or mutate) the original my_nums array. If we want to do that, we can use .collect! with an exclamation point:

# my_nums.collect! { |num| num ** 2 }
# # ==> [1, 4, 9]
# my_nums
# # ==> [1, 4, 9]
# Recall that the ! in Ruby means “this method could do something dangerous or unexpected!” In this case, it mutates the original array instead of creating a new one.

# Instructions
# 1.
# We’ve created an array, fibs, and placed the first ten Fibonacci numbers in it.

# Create a new variable, doubled_fibs, and set it equal to the result of calling fibs.collect. The block you pass to .collect should double each Fibonacci number, similar to the example above.

# puts doubled_fibs if you want to see the final contents of the array.

fibs = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]

# Add your code below!

doubled_fibs = fibs.collect { |x| x * 2 }

puts doubled_fibs

# [2, 2, 4, 6, 10, 16, 26, 42, 68, 110]
