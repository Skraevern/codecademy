# Resolve to Keep Learning
# One of the main purposes of modules is to separate methods and constants into named spaces. This is called (conveniently enough) namespacing, and it’s how Ruby doesn’t confuse Math::PI and Circle::PI.

# See that double colon we just used? That’s called the scope resolution operator, which is a fancy way of saying it tells Ruby where you’re looking for a specific bit of code. If we say Math::PI, Ruby knows to look inside the Math module to get that PI, not any other PI (such as the one we created in Circle).

# Let’s get some practice in with an existing Ruby module: Math.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Use the scope resolution operator to puts the value of PI from the Math module to the console.

# Write your code below!

puts Math::PI
