# The '.reverse' Method
# The .reverse method is called the same way .length is, but instead of asking Ruby to tell you how long a string is, it spits out a backwards version of the string you gave it. For instance,

# "Eric".reverse
# will result in

# "cirE"
# Reversing input can be useful if you want to sort a list of values from highest to lowest instead of lowest to highest. (Weâ€™ll get to sorting in later lessons.)

# Instructions
# 1.
# Call the .reverse method on your name. Donâ€™t forget those quotation marks around your name to make it a string!

# puts the answer to the console if you want to see the value.

puts "Kristian Skreosen".reverse
#=> nesoerkS naitsirK
