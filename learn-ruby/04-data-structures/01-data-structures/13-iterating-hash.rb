# Iterating Over Hashes
# When iterating over hashes, we need two placeholder variables to represent each key/value pair.

# restaurant_menu = {
#   "noodles" => 4,
#   "soup" => 3,
#   "salad" => 2
# }
 
# restaurant_menu.each do |item, price|
#   puts "#{item}: #{price}"
# end
# In the example above, we create a new hash called restaurant_menu.
# Then, we loop through the restaurant_menu hash and assign the key to item and the value to price for each iteration.
# Finally, we puts out:
# noodles: 4
# soup: 3
# salad: 2

# Instructions
# 1.
# Use .each to iterate over the secret_identities hash.

# Use puts to print each key-value pair, separated by a colon and a space (:), to the console, just like the example above. 

secret_identities = {
    "The Batman" => "Bruce Wayne",
    "Superman" => "Clark Kent",
    "Wonder Woman" => "Diana Prince",
    "Freakazoid" => "Dexter Douglas"
  }
    
  secret_identities.each do |ego, name| 
    puts "#{ego}: #{name}" 
  end

# The Batman: Bruce Wayne
# Superman: Clark Kent
# Wonder Woman: Diana Prince
# Freakazoid: Dexter Douglas
