# Proc Syntax
# Procs are easy to define! You just call Proc.new and pass in the block you want to save. Here’s how we’d create a proc called cube that cubes a number (raises it to the third power):

# cube = Proc.new { |x| x ** 3 }
# We can then pass the proc to a method that would otherwise take a block, and we don’t have to rewrite the block over and over!

# [1, 2, 3].collect!(&cube)
# # ==> [1, 8, 27]
# [4, 5, 6].map!(&cube)
# # ==> [64, 125, 216]
# (The .collect! and .map! methods do the exact same thing.)

# The & is used to convert the cube proc into a block (since .collect! and .map! normally take a block). We’ll do this any time we pass a proc to a method that expects a block.

# Instructions
# 1.
# The .floor method rounds a float (a number with a decimal) down to the nearest integer. Write a proc called round_down that will do this rounding (we’ve added the code to pass it to floats.collect).

floats = [1.2, 3.45, 0.91, 7.727, 11.42, 482.911]
# Write your code below this line!

round_down = Proc.new { |x| x.floor }

# Write your code above this line!
ints = floats.collect(&round_down)
print ints

# [1, 3, 0, 7, 11, 482]
