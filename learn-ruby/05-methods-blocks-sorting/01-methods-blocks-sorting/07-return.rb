# Let's Learn Return
# Sometimes we donâ€™t just want a method to print something to the console, but we actually want that method to hand us (or another method!) back a value. For that, we use return.

# def double(n)
#   return n * 2
# end
 
# output = double(6)
# output += 2
# puts output
# In the example above, we define a new method called double that accepts one argument called n.
# Inside the method, we return two times n.
# After that, we call our new double method with an argument of 6 and store the result, 12, in output.
# Then, we increase output to 14 and print it out to the console.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Define a new method called add that takes two numbers as arguments.

# Inside the method, return the sum of those numbers.

def add(x, y)
    return x + y
  end
