# Getting the User's Input
# First things first: we’ll need to get the user’s input.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Use puts to prompt the user for input two times. For the first puts, declare a variable called text and set it equal to the user’s input via gets.chomp.

# For the second puts, declare a variable called redact and set it equal to the user’s input using gets.chomp.

puts "Input word 1"
text = gets.chomp
puts "Word 2"
redact = gets.chomp

# Input word 1:
# s
# Word 2:
# s
