# Ruby is a Delight
# As a language, Ruby prioritizes programmer productivity over program optimization. This means that Ruby may not always run a program in the fastest way possible, but it strives to be a language that programmers (like you!) find easy and fun to use. The more intuitive a language’s syntax is, the more productive its users can be. You’re in control, not the machine!

# Check out the code in the editor. It looks almost like English, doesn’t it?

ruby_is_eloquent = true
ruby_is_ugly = false

puts "Ruby is eloquent!" if ruby_is_eloquent
puts "Ruby's not ugly!" unless ruby_is_ugly

# Ruby is eloquent!
# Ruby's not ugly!
