# Accessing Hash Values
# You can access values in a hash just like an array.

# pets = {
#   "Stevie" => "cat",
#   "Bowser" => "hamster",
#   "Kevin Sorbo" => "fish"
# }
 
# puts pets["Stevie"]
# # will print "cat"
# In the example above, we create a hash called pets.
# Then we print cat by accessing the key "Stevie" in the pets hash.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Access the key-value pair you added to pets, just like step 2 in the example above.

# Use puts to print that value to the console.

pets = Hash.new

pets["Gunn"] = "cat"

print pets["Gunn"]
