# Else
# The partner to the if statement is the else statement. An if/else statement says to Ruby: “If this expression is true, run this code block; otherwise, run the code after the else statement.” Here’s an example:

# if 1 > 2
#   print "I won't get printed because one is less than two."
# else
#   print "That means I'll get printed!"
# end

# Instructions
# 1.
# Try it yourself in the editor! Use any expression you like in your if/else statement, but make sure both branches print a string of your choice to the console.

my_integer = 10

if my_integer > 2
  puts "Bigger"
else 
  puts "Lower"
end
