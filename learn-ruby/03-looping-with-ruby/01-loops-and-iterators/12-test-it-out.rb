# Try It Out!
# Cool, no? Now itâ€™s your turn to take the .each method for a test drive.

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 
# # one way to loop
# numbers.each { |item| puts item }
 
# # another way to loop
# numbers.each do |item|
#   puts item
# end
# In the example above, we create an array called numbers.
# Then we show two different ways to print each item in numbers to the console.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Use the .each method on the odds array to print out double the value of each item of the array. In other words, multiply each item by 2.Make sure to use print rather than puts, so your output appears on one line.

# Check the Hint if you get stuck!

odds = [1,3,5,7,9]

# Add your code below!
odds.each { |item| puts item * 2 }

odds.each do |item|
    puts item * 2
end

# 2
# 6
# 10
# 14
# 18
