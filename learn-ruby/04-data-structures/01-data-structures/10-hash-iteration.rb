# (Re)Introduction to Iteration
# Remember when we covered loops and iterators? We could use a whole bunch of different methods for looping in a program. When we loop over an array or a hash, we say that we iterate over it.

# Weâ€™ll be using the .each iterator to iterate over arrays and hashes in this section. Take a look at the code in the editor to see one example of how we might go about this.

friends = ["Milhouse", "Ralph", "Nelson", "Otto"]

family = { "Homer" => "dad",
  "Marge" => "mom",
  "Lisa" => "sister",
  "Maggie" => "sister",
  "Abe" => "grandpa",
  "Santa's Little Helper" => "dog"
}

friends.each { |x| puts "#{x}" }
family.each { |x, y| puts "#{x}: #{y}" }
