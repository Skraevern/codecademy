# Blocks Are Like Nameless Methods
# Most methods that you’ve worked with have defined names that either you or someone else gave them (i.e. [array].sort(), “string”.downcase(), and so on). You can think of blocks as a way of creating methods that don’t have a name. (These are similar to anonymous functions in JavaScript or lambdas in Python.)

# Blocks can be defined with either the keywords do and end or with curly braces ({}).

# Instructions
# Check out the examples in the editor. Look familiar? Run the code to see the blocks execute their code.

1.times do
    puts "I'm a code block!"
  end
  
  1.times { puts "As am I!" }

# I'm a code block!
# As am I!
