# Learning to Yield
# Why do some methods accept a block and others don’t? It’s because methods that accept blocks have a way of transferring control from the calling method to the block and back again. We can build this into the methods we define by using the yield keyword.

# Instructions
# Check out the code in the editor. We’ve set up a series of puts statements so you can see when we’re in the block_test method and when we’re in the block passed to it. Click Run to see the result

def block_test
    puts "We're in the method!"
    puts "Yielding to the block..."
    yield
    puts "We're back in the method!"
  end
  
  block_test { puts ">>> We're in the block!" }

#   We're in the method!
# Yielding to the block...
# >>> We're in the block!
# We're back in the method!
