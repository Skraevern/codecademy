# Omit Needless Words
# One of the most common suggestions when it comes to writing is to omit needless words, and it applies just as much to writing Ruby as writing stories.

# There are two control structures to change here:

# The unless block:

# unless n.is_a? Integer
#  return "n must be an integer."
# end
# The if block below the unless block:

# if n <= 0
#  return "n must be greater than 0."
# end
# Both blocks can be simplified using the zen of Ruby!

# Instructions
# 1.
# Refactor the code in the editor to use single-line ifs and unlesss.
