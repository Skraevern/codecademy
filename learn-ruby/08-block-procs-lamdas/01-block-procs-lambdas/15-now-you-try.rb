# Now You Try!
# Great work! You’ve written your own lambda and seen how to pass it to a method. Now it’s time for you to write a lambda and pass it to a method!

# If you think this will be a lot like what you’ve already done with procs, you’re exactly right. Just like with procs, we’ll need to put & at the beginning of our lambda name when we pass it to the method, since this will convert the lambda into the block the method expects.

# That symbolize lambda was pretty cool. Let’s riff on it with a lambda that checks to see if each element in an array is a symbol. We can do this checking with the .is_a? method, which returns true if an object is the type of object named and false otherwise:

# :hello.is_a? Symbol
# # ==> true
# The word Symbol has to be capitalized when you’re doing an .is_a? check!

# Instructions
# 1.
# Create a lambda, symbol_filter, that takes one parameter and checks to see if that parameter .is_a? Symbol.

# Create a new variable called symbols, and store the result of calling my_array.select and passing it your lambda.

# puts symbols at the end of the file in order to see the final contents of the array.

my_array = ["raindrops", :kettles, "whiskers", :mittens, :packages]

# Add your code below!
symbol_filter = lambda { |x| x.is_a? Symbol }
symbols = my_array.select(&symbol_filter)

my_array = ["raindrops", :kettles, "whiskers", :mittens, :packages]

puts symbols

# [:kettles, :mittens, :packages]
