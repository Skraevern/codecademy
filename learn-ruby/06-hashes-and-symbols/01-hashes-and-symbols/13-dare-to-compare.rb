# Dare to Compare
# We mentioned that hash lookup is faster with symbol keys than with string keys. Here, we’ll prove it!

# The code in the editor uses some new syntax, so don’t worry about understanding all of it just yet. It builds two alphabet hashes: one that pairs string letters with their place in the alphabet ( “a” with 1, “b” with 2…) and one that uses symbols (:a with 1, :b with 2…). We’ll look up the letter “r” 100,000 times to see which process runs faster!

# It’s good to keep in mind that the numbers you’ll see are only fractions of a second apart, and we did the hash lookup 100,000 times each. It’s not much of a performance increase to use symbols in this case, but it’s definitely there!

# Instructions
# The numbers don’t lie. Click Run to see for yourself!
