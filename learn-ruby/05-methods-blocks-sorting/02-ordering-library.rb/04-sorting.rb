# Sorting
# Great! Now letâ€™s add a little logic to our method.

# numbers = [5, 1, 3, 8]
# numbers.sort!
# puts numbers
# In the above example, we create a new array called numbers.
# Then, we sort the array.
# Finally, we print out 1, 3, 5, 8, the sorted array.
# In Ruby, there are two sorting methods, .sort or sort!. The first method, .sort, simply returns a sorted array while leaving the original array alone. The second method, .sort!, modifies the actual array.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Inside your method, add a line that calls .sort! on the arr array. Since it is the last line of the method, the sorted array will be returned.

# Now test your work! After your method, make a new array called numbers that contains a few numbers like the example above.

# Call your alphabetize method with your numbers array as the parameter and puts the result to the console.

def alphabetize(arr, rev=false)
    arr.sort!
  end
  
  
  numbers = [5, 1, 3, 8]
  puts alphabetize(numbers)
  
#   [1, 3, 5, 8]
