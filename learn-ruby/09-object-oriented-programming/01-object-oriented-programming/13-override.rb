# Override!
# Sometimes you’ll want one class that inherits from another to not only take on the methods and attributes of its parent, but to override one or more of them.

# For instance, you might have an Email class that inherits from Message. Both classes might have a send method that sends them, but the e-mail version may have to identify valid e-mail addresses and use a bunch of e-mail protocols that Message knows nothing about. Rather than add a send_email method to your derived class and inherit a send method you’ll never use, you can instead just explicitly create a send method in the Email class and have it do all the email-sending work.

# This new version of send will override (that is, replace) the inherited version for any object that is an instance of Email.

# Instructions

# Let’s try a more entertaining (if less realistic) example. Create a new class, Dragon, that inherits from Creature. Give your derived class a fight method that overrides Creature‘s; instead of returning “Punch to the chops!”, it should return “Breathes fire!”.

class Creature
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
    
  def fight
    return "Punch to the chops!"
  end
end
  
  # Add your code below!
  
class Dragon < Creature
  def fight
    return "Breathes fire!"
  end
end
