# String Interpolation
# You can always use plain old + or << to add a variable value into a string:

# drink = "espresso"
# "I love " + drink
# # ==> I love espresso
# "I love " << drink
# # ==> I love espresso
# But if you want to do it for non-string values, you have to use .to_s to make it a string:

# age = 26
# "I am " + age.to_s + " years old."
# # ==> "I am 26 years old."
# "I am " << age.to_s << " years old."
# # ==> "I am 26 years old."
# This is complicated, and complicated is not the Ruby way. A better way to do this is with string interpolation. The syntax looks like this:

# "I love #{drink}."
# # ==> I love espresso.
# "I am #{age} years old."
# # ==> I am 26 years old.
# All you need to do is place the variable name inside #{} within a string!

# Instructions
# 1.
# Remove the concatenation operator and rewrite the code to use #{thing}. You will want to puts one complete string on line 6.

favorite_things = ["Ruby", "espresso", "candy"]

puts "A few of my favorite things:"

favorite_things.each do |thing|
  puts "I love #{thing}!"
end


# Output:
# A few of my favorite things:
# I love Ruby!
# I love espresso!
# I love candy!
