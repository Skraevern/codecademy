# The '.length' Method
# Methods are summoned using a .. If you have a string, "I love espresso", and take the .length of it, Ruby will return the length of the string (that is, the number of characters—letters, numbers, spaces, and symbols). Check it out:

# "I love espresso".length
# # ==> 15 
# (That little line starting with the # isn’t part of what you need to write—it just shows you the output Ruby will provide. More on this in the next section!)

# Taking the length of input can be useful if, for example, you want to make a website that takes credit card payments. Ruby can check to make sure the credit card number appears to be valid.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Call the .length method on your name (remember to use quotes around your name).

puts "Kristian Skreosen".length
#=> 17
