# More Methods, More Solutions
# Great work!

# We’ve often found we only want the key or value associated with a key/value pair, and it’s kind of a pain to put both into our block and only work with one. Can we iterate over just keys or just values?

# This is Ruby. Of course we can.

# Ruby includes two hash methods, .each_key and .each_value, that do exactly what you’d expect:

# my_hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
 
# my_hash.each_key { |k| print k, " " }
# # ==> one two three
 
# my_hash.each_value { |v| print v, " " }
# # ==> 1 2 3
# Let’s wrap up our study of Ruby hashes and symbols by testing these methods out.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Go ahead and print out just the titles of our movies using puts.

movie_ratings = {
    memento: 3,
    primer: 3.5,
    the_matrix: 3,
    truman_show: 4,
    red_dawn: 1.5,
    skyfall: 4,
    alex_cross: 2,
    uhf: 1,
    lion_king: 3.5
