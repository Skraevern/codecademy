# There Can Be Only One!
# Any given Ruby class can have only one superclass. Some languages allow a class to have more than one parent, which is a model called multiple inheritance. This can get really ugly really fast, which is why Ruby disallows it.

# However, there are instances where you want to incorporate data or behavior from several classes into a single class, and Ruby allows this through the use of mixins. We’ll learn about mixins in a later lesson! For now, we’ll demonstrate what happens if you try to do multiple inheritance in Ruby.

# The demo code we’re about to show you includes a fancy trick: if you want to end a Ruby statement without going to a new line, you can just type a semicolon. This means you can write something like

# class Monkey
# end
# on just one line: class Monkey; end. This is a time saver when you’re writing something very short, like an empty class or method definition.

# Instructions
# Check out the code in the editor. See how we’re trying to get Dragon to inherit from Creature and Person? We’ll get a superclass mismatch for class Dragon error if we try this. Run the code to see for yourself!

class Creature
    def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    end
end

class Person
    def initialize(name)
        @name = name
    end
end

class Dragon < Creature; end
class Dragon < Person; end

# superclass mismatch for class Dragon
