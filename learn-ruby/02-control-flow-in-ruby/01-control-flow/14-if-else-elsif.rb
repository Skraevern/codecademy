# CONTROL FLOW IN RUBY
# If, Else, and Elsif
# All right! You’re all on your lonesome. (Well, not quite. We’ll just leave this example here.)

# a = 10
# b = 11
# if a < b
#   print "a is less than b!"
# elsif b < a
#   print "b is less than a!"
# else
#   print "b is equal to a!"
# end

# Instructions
# 1.
# Create an if/else statement in the editor. Make sure to include at least one elsif. Each branch of the statement should print something to the console.

if 1 > 2
    print "bigger"
  elsif 1 == 2
    print "same"
  else
    print "lower"
  end
