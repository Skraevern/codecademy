# Call Me Maybe
# Nice work! Calling a proc with a method isn’t too tricky. However, there’s an even easier way.

# Unlike blocks, we can call procs directly by using Ruby’s .call method. Check it out!

# test = Proc.new { # does something }
# test.call
# # does that something!
# Remember: there’s always more than one way to do something in Ruby.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Go ahead and create a proc called hi that puts "Hello!", then .call it!

hi = Proc.new { puts "Hello!" }

hi.call

# Hello!
