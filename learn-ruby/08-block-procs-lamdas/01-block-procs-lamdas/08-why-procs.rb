# Why Procs?
# Why bother saving our blocks as procs? There are two main advantages:

# Procs are full-fledged objects, so they have all the powers and abilities of objects. (Blocks do not.)
# Unlike blocks, procs can be called over and over without rewriting them. This prevents you from having to retype the contents of your block every time you need to execute a particular bit of code.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Check out the code in the editor. Woof, we had to rewrite that block a bunch of times! Remove the blocks and replace them with a proc called over_4_feet so that the code in the block only needs to be written once.

# Here at the amusement park, you have to be four feet tall
# or taller to ride the roller coaster. Let's use .select on
# each group to get only the ones four feet tall or taller.


# group_1 = [4.1, 5.5, 3.2, 3.3, 6.1, 3.9, 4.7]
# group_2 = [7.0, 3.8, 6.2, 6.1, 4.4, 4.9, 3.0]
# group_3 = [5.5, 5.1, 3.9, 4.3, 4.9, 3.2, 3.2]

# # Complete this as a new Proc
# over_4_feet = ________________

# # Change these three so that they use your new over_4_feet Proc
# can_ride_1 = group_1.select { |height| height >= 4 }
# can_ride_2 = group_2.select { |height| height >= 4 }
# can_ride_3 = group_3.select { |height| height >= 4 }

# puts can_ride_1
# puts can_ride_2
# puts can_ride_3

group_1 = [4.1, 5.5, 3.2, 3.3, 6.1, 3.9, 4.7]
