# Inclusive and Exclusive Ranges
# You saw a bit of new syntax in the previous exercise: for num in 1...10. What this says to Ruby is: “For the variable num in the range 1 to 10, do the following.” The following was to puts "#{num}", so as num took on the values of 1 to 9, one at a time, those values were printed to the console.

# The reason this program counted to 9 and not 10 was that we used three dots in the range; this tells Ruby to exclude the final number in the count: for num in 1...10 means “go up to but don’t include 10.” If we use two dots, this tells Ruby to include the highest number in the range.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Update the for loop in the editor in two ways:

# Make it print the numbers 1 to 15, including 15.
# Change it to use .. instead of ...

for num in 1..15
    puts num
  end
