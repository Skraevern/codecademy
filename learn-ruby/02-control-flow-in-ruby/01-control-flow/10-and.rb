# And
# Comparators aren’t the only operators available to you in Ruby. You can also use logical or boolean operators. Ruby has three: and (&&), or (||), and not (!). Boolean operators result in boolean values: true or false.

# The boolean operator and, &&, only results in true when both expression on either side of && are true. Here’s how && works:

# true && true # => true
# true && false # => false
# false && true # => false
# false && false # => false
# For example, 1 < 2 && 2 < 3 is true because it’s true that one is less than two and that two is less than three.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Let’s practice a bit with &&. Check out the boolean expressions and set each variable to true or false depending on what value you expect the expression to return.

# boolean_1 = 77 < 78 && 77 < 77
boolean_1 = false

# boolean_2 = true && 100 >= 100
boolean_2 =  true

# boolean_3 = 2**3 == 8 && 3**2 == 9
boolean_3 = true
