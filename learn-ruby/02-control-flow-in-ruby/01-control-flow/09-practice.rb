# Practice Makes Perfect
# Great work so far! You know what they say: practice makes perfect. Let’s try a few more comparators to make sure you’ve got the hang of this.

# Instructions
# 1.
# For this round, we’ll show you the comparators and you set each variable to true or false depending on what value you expect the expression to return. Remember: no quotes around true and false!

# test_1 = 77 != 77
test_1 = false

# test_2 = -4 <= -4
test_2 = true

# test_3 = -44 < -33
test_3 = true

# test_4 = 100 == 1000
test_4 = false
