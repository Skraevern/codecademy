# Looping with 'While'
# Okay, training wheels off. Let’s see your stuff!

# i = 3
# while i > 0 do
#   print i
#   i -= 1
# end
# In the above example, we create a variable called i and set it to 3.
# Then, we print out 321 since we execute the loop as long as i is positive.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Use a while loop to print out the numbers 1 through 50, inclusive. While the example above counts down, you will want to count up.Use print rather than puts, and don’t forget to increment your variable.

i = 1
while i <= 50 do
  print "#{i} "
  i += 1
end
