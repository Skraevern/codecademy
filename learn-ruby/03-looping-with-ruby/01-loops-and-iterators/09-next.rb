# Next!
# The next keyword can be used to skip over certain steps in the loop. For instance, if we donâ€™t want to print out the even numbers, we can write:

# for i in 1..5
#   next if i % 2 == 0
#   print i
# end
# In the above example, we loop through the range of 1 through 5, assigning each number to i in turn.
# If the remainder of i / 2 is zero, we go to the next iteration of the loop.
# Then we print the value of i. This line only prints out 1, 3, and 5 because of the previous line.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Add a line to your loop before your print statement. Use the next keyword so that you skip to the next iteration if the number i is odd.

# Use the example above for help, but remember that the example above skips even numbers.

# i = 20
# loop do
#   i -= 1
#   print "#{i}"
#   break if i <= 0
# end

i = 20
loop do
  i -= 1
  next if i % 2 != 0
  puts i
  break if i <= 0
end


# Output:
# 18
# 16
# 14
# 12
# 10
# 8
# 6
# 4
# 2
# 0
