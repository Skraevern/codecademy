# When Good isn't Good Enough
# On the flip side, sometimes you’ll be working with a derived class (or subclass) and realize that you’ve overwritten a method or attribute defined in that class’ base class (also called a parent or superclass) that you actually need. Have no fear! You can directly access the attributes or methods of a superclass with Ruby’s built-in super keyword.

# The syntax looks like this:

# class DerivedClass < Base
#   def some_method
#     super(optional args)
#       # Some stuff
#     end
#   end
# end
# When you call super from inside a method, that tells Ruby to look in the superclass of the current class and find a method with the same name as the one from which super is called. If it finds it, Ruby will use the superclass’ version of the method.

# Instructions
# 1.
# We decided we want to do some chops-punching after all! Let’s do two things:

# Add puts "Instead of breathing fire..." as the first line in our Dragon‘s fight method.
# Replace the return statement inside Dragon‘s definition of fight with the keyword super. (No need to pass any arguments to super, since Creature‘s fight method doesn’t take any.)

class Creature
    def initialize(name)
      @name = name
    end
    
    def fight
      return "Punch to the chops!"
    end
  end
  
  # Add your code below!
  
  class Dragon < Creature
    def fight
      puts "Instead of breathes fire..."
      super
    end
  end

# Instead of breathes fire...
# Punch to the chops!
