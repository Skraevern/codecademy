# Hashes
# Good! Now letâ€™s create a hash. Feel free to use either hash literal notation or Hash.new.

# prices = { 
#   "apple" => 0.52,
#   "banana" => 0.23,
#   "kiwi" => 1.42
# }
 
# sounds = Hash.new
# sounds["dog"] = "woof"
# sounds["cat"] = "meow"

# Instructions
# 1.
# Create a hash called my_hash in the editor.

# Give it at least one key-value pair.

my_hash = {
    "apple" => 20,
    "kiwi" => 2
  }
