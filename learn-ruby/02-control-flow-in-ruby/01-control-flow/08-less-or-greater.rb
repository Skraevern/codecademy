# Less Than or Greater Than
# We can also check to see if one value is less than, less than or equal to, greater than, or greater than or equal to another. Those operators look like this:

# Less than: <
# Less than or equal to: <=
# Greater than: >
# Greater than or equal to: >=

# Instructions
# 1.
# Weâ€™ve set up a few variables in the editor. We want them all to evaluate to true. Your job: replace the __s with <, <=, >, or >= to make the expression for each variable true!
