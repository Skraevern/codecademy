# The Ruby Lambda
# Like procs, lambdas are objects. The similarities donâ€™t stop there: with the exception of a bit of syntax and a few behavioral quirks, lambdas are identical to procs.

# Check out the code in the editor. See the lambda bit? Typing

# lambda { puts "Hello!" }
# Is just about the same as

# Proc.new { puts "Hello!" }
# In the example to the right, when we pass the lambda to lambda_demo, the method calls the lambda and executes its code.

# Instructions
# Now that you know how blocks and procs work, you should be able to guess what this lambda will puts to the console. Click Run to confirm your suspicions!

def lambda_demo(a_lambda)
    puts "I'm the method!"
    a_lambda.call
  end
  
  lambda_demo(lambda { puts "I'm the lambda!" })


# Output:
# I'm the method!
# I'm the lambda!
