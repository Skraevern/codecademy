# Sorting the Hash
# Great! We have a hash full of word / frequency key-value pairs. Now we need to figure out a way to get our information in the order we want it.

# colors = { 
#   "blue" => 3,
#   "green" => 1,
#   "red" => 2
# }
# colors = colors.sort_by do |color, count|
#   count
# end
# colors.reverse!
# In the example above, we first create a hash called colors that maps color strings to numbers.
# Then, we sort colors into green, red, and blue, from smallest to largest by count. Just so you know, the .sort_by function returns an array of arrays, but thatâ€™s fine for our purposes.
# Finally, we reverse the array order so that the colors with the largest counts are first.
# Can you do the same thing with the frequencies hash?

# Instructions
# 1.
# Use .sort_by to sort the frequencies hash by word count, like step 2 above. Store the result back in frequencies.

# Use .reverse! to reverse the sorted frequencies array.

# Check the Hint for more details!

puts "Text please:"
text = gets.chomp

words = text.split(" ")

frequencies = Hash.new(0)

words.each { |word| frequencies[word] += 1 }

frequencies.sort_by do |word, count| 
  count 
end
frequencies.reverse_each
