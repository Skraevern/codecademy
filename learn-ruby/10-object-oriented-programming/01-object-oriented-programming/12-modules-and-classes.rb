# The Marriage of Modules and Classes
# What we did in the last exercise might not have seemed strange to you, but think about it: we mixed together the behaviors of a class and a module!

# When a module is used to mix additional behavior and information into a class, it’s called a mixin. Mixins allow us to customize a class without having to rewrite code!

# Instructions
# Check out the code in the editor. See how we define the jump method in the Action module, then mix it into the Rabbit and Cricket classes? Click Run to see the effect!

module Action
    def jump
      @distance = rand(4) + 2
      puts "I jumped forward #{@distance} feet!"
    end
  end
  
  class Rabbit
    include Action
    attr_reader :name
    def initialize(name)
      @name = name
    end
  end
  
  class Cricket
    include Action
    attr_reader :name
    def initialize(name)
      @name = name
    end
  end
  
  peter = Rabbit.new("Peter")
  jiminy = Cricket.new("Jiminy")
  
  peter.jump
  jiminy.jump

#   I jumped forward 2 feet!
# I jumped forward 3 feet!
