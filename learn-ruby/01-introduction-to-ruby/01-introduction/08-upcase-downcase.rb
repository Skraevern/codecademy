# '.upcase' & '.downcase'
# Letâ€™s try one more method (er, two methods). As you might have guessed, the .upcase and .downcase methods convert a string to ALL UPPER CASE or all lower case, respectively.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Call .upcase on your name to make your name ALL CAPS and use puts to print it to the screen, like this:

# puts "eric".upcase    # ==> ERIC
# On the next line, call .downcase to make your name all lower case. Make sure to use puts so you can see it printed out!

puts "Kristian Skreosen".upcase
#=> KRISTIAN SKREOSEN

puts "Kristian Skreosen".downcase
#=> kristian skreosen
