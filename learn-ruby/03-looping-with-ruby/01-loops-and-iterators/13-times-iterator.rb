# The .times Iterator
# The .times method is like a super compact for loop: it can perform a task on each item in an object a specified number of times.

# For example, if we wanted to print out "Chunky bacon!" ten times, we might type

# 10.times { print "Chunky bacon!" }
# We donâ€™t know why we would type that, but we could!

# Instructions
# 1.
# Use the .times operator to print out a string of your choice any number of times you like. Use the code in the text above as a guide if you need help.

10.times { print "Hello, World! "}

# Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World!
